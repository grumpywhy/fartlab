🧪 FartLab: The Science of Flatulence
FartLab is an interactive web application that explores the chemical composition of flatulence in a scientifically accurate yet humorous way. Created for educational and entertainment purposes, this project combines real scientific data with interactive elements to demystify the biochemistry behind a universal human experience.
🔬 Features

Chemical Composition Breakdown: Detailed information about the gases that make up flatulence (N₂, H₂, CO₂, CH₄, O₂, H₂S)
Interactive F.A.R.T. Synthesizer: Create custom flatulence by adjusting gas ratios and acoustic parameters
Audio Simulation: Generate and play scientifically plausible flatulence sounds based on your parameters
Comprehensive Analysis: Get detailed reports on smell characteristics, sound profiles, and physical properties
F.A.R.T. Score: Quantitative assessment based on Volume, Stank, and Velocity metrics

📊 Scientific Accuracy
While presented in a humorous way, the chemical and biological information in this project is based on actual scientific research:

Gas composition percentages reflect real studies on human intestinal gases
Olfactory properties correlate to actual chemical components
Sound generation algorithms model the physics of sphincter oscillation and gas turbulence

🚀 Technologies Used
